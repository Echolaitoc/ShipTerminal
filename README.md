# Beneath a Metal Sky Map
Unity Project for a small app to display a map of the ISS Auerbach in the scenario "Beneath a Metal Sky" in the pen & paper RPG Dread.

The project was done in Unity 5.0 and I've only recently ported it to Unity 2018 with minimal adjustments.
It does not utilize the GUI system of Unity, something I regret. The entire UI is built from code.

The app has been mentioned by the creators of Dread on their blog. You can download compiled versions for OSX, Windows and Linux from their servers over at https://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/digital-map-for-beneath-a-metal-sky/
